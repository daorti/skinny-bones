I am Telecommunication Engineer and I am currently working as Data Scientist at Banco Santander, in Strategy Department. The aim of my current job is to help the business units of the organization to use data, in order to make better decisions, based on data.

When I was working in Microsoft, as an evangelist, I taught its new technologies to all types of audiences(clients, partners, developers, students). I learnt the latest Microsoft technologies (mainly focused on Cloud, IoT, BI, AI and Machine Learning) and taught them by giving talks, workshops, support, and writing articles. Even as an intern, I have given talks at several universities and important events such as the TechFest. I have created proof of concept for clients and I have given workshops to them. I have also been a researcher intern at the Polytechnic University of Madrid, working on a project related to IoT and data processing.
